# ClassCraft AI

ClassCraft AI is an AI-powered teaching assistant designed for Further Education colleges.

The platform helps lecturers create lesson plans, learning resources, and curriculum-aligned materials faster, reducing administrative workload and freeing up time for teaching.

ClassCraft AI is being developed with real-world teaching use in mind and is currently being piloted in Scottish colleges.

## What it does

- Supports faster lesson planning and resource creation  
- Helps align materials with curriculum and awarding-body requirements  
- Reduces repetitive administrative tasks for lecturers  
- Designed specifically for Further Education, not generic classroom use  

## Why it exists

Lecturers spend a significant amount of time planning lessons, preparing resources, and handling administrative work.  
ClassCraft AI aims to streamline these tasks using AI, without replacing professional judgement or teaching expertise.

## Project status

The platform is live and under active development, with ongoing trials and feature expansion based on educator feedback.
